## Important release notes for V5+

Pin assignments for D2, D3, and A3 have changed:
- D3 is now the main alert output (previously D2).
- A3 is now the inverted output, so you must disconnect any jumper there to avoid a dead short.
- D2 is now the switch for Fahrenheit display.
- The "persistent output" feature (previously on D2) has been removed.
